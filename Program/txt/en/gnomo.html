<h1>Gnomonic projection</h1>

<p>This map seems highly distorted. Not only it is apparent, but you can confirm it by Tissot's ellipses. However, it has a unique feature: all shortest paths on Earth (geodesics) are drawn as straight lines. Thus, if you want that the shortest path between two points to be (to appear) the straight line, you must distort the map that much.</p>

<p>Besides, not the whole Earth can be displayed, only a small portion smaller than a half-sphere. The center of the projection is taken at our location <!-- this might not be true for all exhibitions /-->, but you can choose any point. You can create this map by projecting each point on the Earth's surface from the center of the Earth onto a tangent plane at our location. <!-- same here /--></p>

<ul>
	<li>Choose two cities and find the shortest path between them, and name the countries you fly over following this path in an airplane.</li>

	<li>Find the shortest path from Jerusalem (Israel) to La Habana (Cuba). Does it cross Africa? Would you say that looking at other
projections? 

	<li>And flying from Antananarivo (Madagascar) to Wellington (New Zealand), do we fly over Australia? Note that you can't answer this and the previous question with a single gnomonic map.

	<li> What shape do parallels and meridians adopt? </li>
</ul>

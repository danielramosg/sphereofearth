<h1>Azimuthal equidistant projection</h1>

<p>Maps don't need to be rectangular. This is a circular map where we are at the center of the world (but you could choose any point on Earth). After fixing our location at the center, we draw points equidistant to us over concentric circles around the center, using their distance to us as the radius. Thus, the distance from us to any point of the Earth is displayed correctly over this map (but only distances from us!). The angle
between the radius joining our position and the destination point and the North of the map (vertical direction) is also correct.</p> 

<p>This would be a very useful map to have at the city airport, since you can get a good idea of how long is your trip and which countries are you flying over. You can also see directly how far different cities are from you. </p>

<p> How much does this construction distorts the reality? Tissot's ellipses answer that. You can see that the center of the map is the only point at true scale. Clearly the distortion is rotationally symmetric, and all the ellipses have the same minor axis (which points in the radial direction), because radial directions are not distorted by construction.</p>

<ul>
	<li> Choose some distant cities, for instance New York (USA), Cape Town (South Africa) and Tokio (Japan). Which one is closer to you? </li>
	<li> What is the diameter of this map? </li>
	<li> How many countries can you visit travelling less than 10,000 km? and less than 20,000 km? </li>
	<li> Your antipode is the point on Earth diametrically opposed to you. Where is this point on the map? </li>
</ul>

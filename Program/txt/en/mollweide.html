<h1>Mollweide projection</h1>

<p>This projection fills an ellipse with axes in proportion 2:1. It partially solves a problem with all cylindrical projections (such as
Plate-Carrée, Mercator, Gall-Peters and others), namely that the poles are not displayed at one unique location. North pole on Plate-Carrée
corresponds to the whole upper border of the map rectangle. Mercator projection is even worse, since the poles are represented at infinity. This hugely distorts polar regions, such as the Antarctica. Mollweide projections solves this and reduces the distortion.</p>

<p> If you test some Tissot's ellipses, you can observe that Mollweide projection is equal-area, that is, the areas of
regions are preserved (hence all Tissot's ellipses have the same area). Also, its rounded shape reminds us the sphericity of the Earth, which is not apparent on other squared maps.</p>

<ul>
	<li> How are parallels and meridians displayed? </li>
	<li> Compare this projection with Gall-Peters projection. Both are equal-area. Which one do you think distorts the Earth the least? </li>
	<li> Are there points at true scale on this map?
</ul>

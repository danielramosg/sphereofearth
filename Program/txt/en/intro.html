<h1>What is a map?</h1>

<p>A <i>map projection</i> is a flat representation of the surface of the Earth. There are infinitely many ways of representing the Earth on a
plane, but all of them will distort its appearance in some way. There is no perfect projection, and choosing one or another will depend on the purpose of your map.</p>

<p>In this program, you can explore and compare the distortion of several map projections. Select one of the maps, move your pointer over the map and you will see some ellipses. These ellipses visualize the distortion of the map.</p>

<h2>Can we measure the distortion?</h2>

<p>The distortion of a map is a complicated magnitude that cannot be completely measured by a single number. Instead, the French
mathematician and cartographer Nicolas Auguste Tissot invented in 1859 a graphical method to display the distortion produced at any point on a map. 
</p>
<p>
Imagine a small circle around a point on the Earth. If we project this circle onto the map, it will no longer appear as a circle, because of the
distortion. If the circle is small enough (an infinitesimal circle), it will be projected onto an ellipse (an infinitesimal ellipse). We
can display this ellipse magnified so we can see it on the map. This ellipse is called a <i>Tissot's indicatrix</i> for the map.</p>

<p> The properties of Tissot's ellipses (axes directions, eccentricity, area...) give several information about the distortion. For instance, if the ellipse is actually a circle, it means that the shape is not distorted at this point (the boundary turns green in the program); if the area corresponds to the area of the circle it represents, it means that the size is not distorted at this point (the interior turns green).</p>

<p>
Mathematically, a map projection is a mapping from the sphere to the plane. Tissot's ellipses are the image under the differential map of circles on tangent planes.

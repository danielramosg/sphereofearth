<h1>What is a map?</h1>

<p>A <i>map projection</i> is a flat representation of the surface of the Earth. There are infinitely many ways of representing the Earth on a
plane, but all of them will distort its appearance in one way or another. Depending on the purpose of our map, we may need to preserve
faithfully some properties of the Earth at the expenses of losing others. For instance, on a navigational map it is important to keep track
of the angle between our route and the North, since we can compare it with the direction of the North on the compass. If we need to display
for instance climate regions of the Earth, it will be much more useful to use a map that does not distort areas.</p>


<h2>Can we measure the distortion?</h2>

<p>The distortion of a map is a complicated magnitude that cannot be completely measured by a single number. Instead, the French
mathematician Nicolas Auguste Tissot invented in 1859 a graphical method to display the distortion produced at any point on a map. 
</p>
<p>
Imagine a small circle around a point on the Earth. If we project this circle onto the map, it will no longer appear as a circle, because of the
distortion. If the circle is small enough (an infinitesimal circle), it will be projected onto an ellipse (an infinitesimal ellipse). We
can display this ellipse magnified so we can see it on the map. This ellipse is called a <i>Tissot's indicatrix</i> for the map, and its properties (axes directions, eccentricity, area...) give several informations about the distortion.</p>

Mathematically, a map projection is a mapping from the sphere to the plane. Tissot ellipses are the image under the differential map of (small) circles in the tangent planes.

<p>In this program, you can explore and compare the distortion of several map projections. Select one of the maps, move your pointer over the map and click on it to permanently fix a certain Tissot ellipse.

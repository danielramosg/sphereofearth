<h1>Mercator projection</h1>

<p>This projection was invented by Gerardus Mercator in 1569, and it is with no doubt the most important map projection in History. Most common maps use this projection. </p>

<p>The Mercator projection is a vertical deformation of the Plate Carrée projection. Since the parallels
appeared longer than they are, the meridians have been stretched the same amount, so that the map is equally stretched vertically and
horizontally at each point. The regions and areas are greatly distorted, but on the other hand we achieve an important feature: shapes and
angles are preserved. If you observe carefully a "square" of 10 degrees of latitude and longitude on the graticule on the Earth globe, close to the poles, you will realize that these "squares" are much more like rectangles.</p>

<p>Draw some Tissot's ellipses. You will find that all of them are circles, but with varying size. This means that the distortion is equal in all the directions from a point, but different from point to point. Hence, the shape and angles are preserved, but not distances. A map projection that preserves angles is said to be <i>conformal</i>.</p>

<p>A key feature for navigation is the following: Imagine you want to sail from a city to another across an ocean. You can draw the straight line joining these cities on the Mercator map. This line (called <i>loxodrome</i> or rhumb line) makes a constant angle with the vertical meridians, pointing Northwards. Since the angles are preserved, this is the true angle you need to keep constant with the North on your boat (obtained with your compass or with the Pole star). Thus the Mercator map allows, and allowed during centuries, to find a path between two points on the globe. Beware: this loxodrome is only a path easy to follow, not the shortest!</p>

<ul>
	<li> Imagine you are in 16th century and you want to navigate from Cádiz (Southern Spain) to Caracas (today Venezuela) in your caravel.
Which is the easiest route (loxodrome) to follow? </i>

	<li> Imagine you want to fly in present day from Athens (Greece) to Los Angeles (USA). Which is the loxodrome joining this two cities? If you actually take a plane covering a direct route from Athens to Los Angeles, you will find that you fly over a large snow land. It's
Greenland. Why? </i>

	<li> Let us compare the areas of Africa and Greenland. Which is bigger, at first sight? Pick a medium or small size for the ellipses.
How many of them can you put over Greenland? and over Africa? Recall that Tissot's ellipses may seem different, but <i>represent the same disc</i> over the Earth. <!--(Answer: Africa is 14 times bigger than Greenland).-->

<h1>Gall-Peters projection</h1>

<p>When Mercator projection tries to fix the deformation of the Plate-Carr√©e projection by correcting the angles, this greatly distorts
surfaces and areas. Other projections, such as Gall-Peters', can be designed to preserve areas.</p>

<p>Gall-Peters map is said to be a "third
world map" because countries in Africa and South America (and all regions close to the equator) are given a pre-eminent place. If
Africa appears bigger than Europe, it is because it actually <i>is</i> bigger (areas are correct). However, shape is not preserved. Africa is
not as skinny as it appears on this map.</p>

<p> Draw some Tissot's ellipses. All of them have the same area and that is why they are drawn with green interior. This means that the vertical distortion and the horizontal distortion <i>compensate</i> each other, in a way that the ellipses keep their area invariant. </p>

<ul>
	<li> Which continent is bigger, North America or Africa? Answer looking at the Gall-Peters projection. Would you say the same looking at
the Mercator projection? (Answer: North America is about 24,709,000 km<sup>2</sup> an Africa about 30,221,532 km<sup>2</sup>.) </li>

	<li> Find the points on the map represented at true scale (i.e. those where the Tissot's ellipse is a unit circle). You will find that the map is then split in three bands: one central band where the stretching is vertical (the continents are skinny) and two surrounding bands where the stretching is horizontal (the continents are flattened).</li>

</ul>

<h1>Plate Carrée projection</h1>

<p>This is maybe the simplest projection. One just writes the longitude and latitude as the x and y coordinates of the plane. Therefore the
graticule (the grid of meridians and parallels) forms an evenly distributed square grid. How realistic is this representation? </p>

<p>Click on the map and you will get some small ellipses (called Tissot's ellipses). These ellipses <i>represent</i> small circles, but in general they are not circular due to the map's distortion.</p>

<p>Put some Tissot's ellipses along the equator, you will see that they are circular and green. This means that any point on the equator is <i>not</i> distorted, the map is faithful on these points, and one says that these points are at <i>true scale</i>.</p>

<p>Now draw some ellipses away from the equator and closer to the North or South pole. You will observe that the ellipses are wider, but with the same height. This means that the map distorts the reality, but only in the horizontal direction, and the magnitude of this horizontal distortion is bigger the further we are from the equator.</p>

<ul>
	<li> Each square on the graticule represents 10º on the Earth. But is the graticule on the Earth also squarish? Check a cell of the graticule near the equator and near the poles on a globe. Do they have sides of equal length? How much measures 10º of an arc of parallel at the equator? And at latitude 70ºN? </li>
<!--the expected answer is just "Much less in the 70ºN parallel than in the equator", not the precise answer "About 40,000 km * 10/360 = 1,111km in the equator and 1,111 km * cos(70º) = 380 km at 70ºN-->

	<li> How do the Tissot's ellipses look like at the poles? Where are the two poles in the map?
</ul>

<h1>Plate Carrée projection</h1>

<p>This is maybe the simplest projection. One just writes the longitude and latitude as the x and y coordinates of the plane. Therefore the
graticule forms an evenly distributed square grid. Is this representation faithful? </p>

<p>Click on the map and you will get some small ellipses (called Tissot's ellipses). These ellipses <i>represent</i> small circles, but they are not round due to the map distortion.</p>

<p>Put some Tissot's ellipses along the equator, you will see that they are round and green. This means that the points on the equator are <i>not</i> distorted, the map is faithful on these points, and one say that these points are at <i>true scale</i>.</p>

<p>Now draw some ellipses away from the equator and closer to the North or South poles. Observe that the ellipses are wider, but with the same height. This means that the map distorts the reality, but only in the horizontal direction, and the magnitude of this horizontal distortion is bigger the further we are from the equator.</p>

<ul>
	<li> Each square on the graticule represents 10º on the Earth. But do the graticule on the Earth is "squared"? Check a "square" of the graticule near the equator and near the poles on a globe. Do they have sides of equal length? How much measures 10º of an arc of parallel at the equator? And at latitude 70ºN? </li>

	<li> How are Tissot's ellipses at the poles? Where are the two poles in the map?
</ul>
